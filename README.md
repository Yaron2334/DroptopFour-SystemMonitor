# DroptopFour-SystemMonitor
A System Monitoring App for [Droptop Four](https://github.com/Droptop-Four).

It runs with HWiNFO on the Backend and offers many options to add to SystemMonitor. 
Special Thanks go to [Cariboudjan](https://github.com/Cariboudjan)  for helping with the Integration into DropTop Four.


SETUP:
1. Download and Install both [HWiNFO show Reg_1.0.rmskin](https://github.com/Yaron2334/DroptopFour-SystemMonitor/blob/main/HWiNFO%20show%20Reg_1.0.rmskin) and the latest release of [SystemMonitor-Yaron_#Version#.rmskin](https://github.com/Yaron2334/DroptopFour-SystemMonitor/releases).
2. To make HWiNFO ready follow the linked guide below and set the following Metrics to "Report Value to Gadget":

- Physical Memory Used
- Physical Memory Load
- Total CPU Usage
- CPU Package
- CPU Package Power
- Temperature 1 (You can set any Metric you want here)
- Temperature 2 (You can set any Metric you want here)
- Temperature 3 (You can set any Metric you want here)
- Temperature 4 (You can set any Metric you want here)
- Fan 1 (Set any Metric you want here)
- Fan 2 (Set any Metric you want here)
- Drive Airflow Temperature
- Read Activity
- Write Activity
- Read Rate
- Write Rate
- GPU Thermal Diode
- GPU Fan (ODN)
- GPU Chip Power
- GPU Utilization
- GPU Fan PWM
- Current DL rate
- Current UL rate

The hardest part is done!

2. Open SystemMonitor-Yaron in Droptop Four go to Preferences -> "Variables config" and follow the Instructions in the document.

(3. You can rename the temperature/fan (or any other) meters in HWiNFO by rightclicking -> rename. This will automaticaly change the Name in System Monitor.)
